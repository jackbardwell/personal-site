      <p>Jack Bardwell is an artist and designer in the broadest sense of the words. His projects often include a participatory aspect with use of speculative twists on the everyday wheather through materials or narrative.</p> 

      <p>This is a kind of holding page for a portfolio site of sorts. In the mean time I want it to be a place that shows the work I do can host some writing an can act as a space for me to come back to a kind of anchor for my practice.</p>
